## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 - When: Nov. 29, around 8pm
 - Where: Online via Discord

#### Decisions that turned out well

Our decision to split our team into front-end and back-end once again paid dividends in this iteration. By this iteration, the front-end and back-end team members have become very well-versed in their respective languages/frameworks, which likely would not have happened if we expected each team member to be a full-stack developer. Having separate group chats for each sub-team created two productive environments for technical questions that didn’t require bothering the other team and left our main group chat clean and uncluttered. The coordinators did a great job focusing their respective teams on the important tasks and communicating with each other on how to integrate their work.

The way we decided to schedule our meetings worked very well this iteration. We had 100%, on-time attendance due to our decision to meet online instead of in-person. Our sync-up meetings at tutorial were also very successful. We had each member of the team one-by-one explain what they’re doing, what they’re planning to do, and what obstacles they had run into. This cleared up a lot of confusion and created a coherent plan for the future. Since most of our work is done in our sub-teams, it was really helpful to have both the front-end and back-end come together and update the other on its progress.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

As every one of us is a busy student at a very work-heavy university, we had some trouble keeping our workflow consistent. We ended up doing most of the work for this deliverable close to the deadline, resulting in code that a bit too rushed. Some of the back-end features, like returning HTML to be displayed, required the front-end to complete their features first, like formatting the HTML, which caused some minor bottlenecks. This was all due to our decision to have developers work on their own schedule.

Similar to last iteration, we had a bit of an imbalance between the front-end and back-end in terms of workload. Last iteration, we expected too much of the front-end. Consequently, for this iteration, there was too much work for the back-end and not enough work on the front-end. In this way, our team is still being affected by our poor estimates in the planning phase of deliverable 2.

#### Planned changes

As previously mentioned, we allowed developers to work on their own schedule, resulting in an inconsistent workflow with most of the features completed close to the deadline. If there were to be another iteration, we’d discuss our schedules beforehand and create rough deadlines within the iteration for certain features. We’d search for any dependencies between features, and try to make sure that the features that other features depend on are finished early.

We’ve also mentioned previously that we’ve suffered from an imbalanced workload on the front-end vs. the back end in our last two iterations. If there were to be another iteration, we would ensure that this would not happen again by spending more time on the planning phase. We’d focus heavily on the estimates of how long front-end and back-end tasks will take, ensuring that those estimates are accurate and balanced between the teams.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

(back-end) implement search functionality on the search page
(back-end) implement the search criteria functionality on the search page
(front-end) create the form for creating a new listing, which includes support for bundles (i.e. multiple textbooks)
(back-end) implement listing creation and editing
(front-end) create the active listings page, where a user can view his/her “active” listing (i.e. listings currently on the marketplace), mark them as sold (hence removing them from the marketplace), edit them, or delete them
(back-end) implement listing deletion
(front-end) create the profile page, where users can view and edit their information (email, phone number, etc.)
(front-end) create the inactive listings page, where a user can view their sold listings,  “reactivate” a sold listing (hence placing it back on the marketplace) or delete a sold listing

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We completed all the tasks that we planned for this iteration! However, that doesn’t mean we completed all the tasks we wanted to at the beginning of our project. Certain features, like price comparison with Amazon and the UofT bookstore and email notifications when a certain textbook is posted, were not able to completed in time. We knew that we wouldn’t have time for these complex features, which is why we didn’t include them in our sprint backlog. This was a calculated decision, however. These features are useful, but ultimately they’re not necessary for our users. In other words, they’re not part of our minimal viable product. We feel like we built our minimal viable product, and delivered what we set out to for our (hypothetical) users.

## Meeting Highlights

There is no next iteration, so in this section, we’re going to talk about our main takeaways from the project in general.

Planning is very important, especially when it comes to team projects. Most of us are still fairly inexperienced at engineering large software systems and are mainly asked to complete small assignments that require minimal planning. We’re therefore used to going straight to coding, and not creating a plan. The more we worked on this project, the more we realized how invaluable the planning we were forced to do was. This is especially important when there are 6 distinct individuals that might want to do things in different ways. A plan forces consistency within the project and makes things easier in the long run.

It’s difficult to learn new technologies on-the-fly. Almost everyone in the group had little to no experience in web development at the beginning of this project. We were forced to learn new languages and frameworks as we worked on them. This lead to a lot of mistakes, and code that could have been written in a more efficient and clean way, given more experience with the language/framework. This is taught us how important it is to have strong foundation of knowledge in technologies before attempting a large-scale project using them.

Teamwork is hard. It’s not easy to coordinate with 5 other team members, each with completely different schedules and levels of experience. Communication is frustrating and hard to manage. You might have to change your schedule to accommodate a team member’s. You might have to take some time out of your day to explain a concept to a team member. There are higher standards for code readability and cleanliness when other people are depending on your code. Though we had difficulties at the beginning of the project, we’ve really come together this iteration and shown why teamwork is ultimately integral to the success of a project. Having structure within our team, a predetermined meeting schedule, and following a methodology (scrum), really helped us alleviate some of the headaches that come with teamwork.
