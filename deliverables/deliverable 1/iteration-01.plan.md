# UBook

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: October 4th, 2018
 * End date: October 14th, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

Front End:
* Our Front End devs will be responsible for the operation and implementation of the user interface of our application.
* They will be responsible for producing the views and designing them accordingly to fit our target users needs while remaining simple enough for ease of learning by novice users

Back End:
* Our Back End devs will be responsible for storing the data of our application
* They will also be responsible for implementing methods to return appropriate (dependent on the request) data upon user request.

Product Owner:
* Responsible for maintaining the product backlog
* Responsible for prioritizing features list for our application
* To act as our lead user of our application in order to help translate a understanding of users and their needs to the development teams.
* Motivate team with a clear and elevating goal

Scrum Master:
* Responsible for the removal and reduction of impediments and blockers of productivity
* Facilitator of meetings
* Ensures the team is adhering to the sprint plan and backlog


#### Events

As our team is constructed of both people who live close to campus as well as commuters, we will have our meetings online via a voice chat app called Discord. We will also have a Facebook group chat for day to day communications and announcements.

We will hold two primary meetings, a sprint planning and a sprint retrospective meeting.

The purpose of our sprint planning meetings is to layout a sprint plan as well as to construct our sprint backlog from our product backlog. We will choose what tasks will be completed based upon our estimations on how much work we can complete during that sprint. Our sprint planning meetings will also include some backlog grooming if necessary. We will also bring up any concerns for the future sprint such as if a team member is unable to take a certain amount of work due to other commitments such as upcoming exams, etc.

The purpose of our sprint retrospective meetings are to evaluate the amount and quality of work done in the recent
sprint. From this evaluation we can make conclusions and observations about the amount of work put into our future
sprint backlogs if for instance we were unable to complete the amount planned previously. We will also discuss the processes we are using for collaboration and implementation of work, so that we can expand on processes that work and re-evaluate those which did not. We will also go over our corresponding sprint plan to see if we were able to meet the goals set.

We will also use our tutorials as a quick weekly catch up where everyone will discuss their work done, their plans for the upcoming week and any concerns if anyone were to have them about their work.


#### Artifacts

The artifact which we will keep and maintain in order to keep track of tasks will be a product backlog which will be
a Google Docs spreadsheet with each task and their respective priority. Tasks will be prioritized by order of importance and each tasks dependency on others, so for example if a task depends on another being implemented prior, we will prioritize the task being depended on over the task which is dependent.

Tasks will be split up and assigned based on the nature of the tasks. So front end tasks will be given to front end
devs and back end tasks to back end devs.

We will also keep a schedule of our planned meetings in a accessible location in order for ease of access for all
team members. We will also take attendance at each meeting whether in person or online in order to ensure all members
are contributing. During each meeting a summary will be produced for future record of what was discussed.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

For this iteration we will firstly get our scrum artifacts set up and have our design artifacts such as CRC diagrams ready. We also want to conduct research into our main competitor to understand our users better.

As a Team Member I want to know the pros and cons of the pre-existing facebook textbook marketplace so that I know what features are beneficial and standard among our market and what features to add to make our product stand out. In order to do this we will analyze the Facebook Textbook Marketplace.

As a Team Member I want to know the different classes we will implement, their responsibilities and how they collaborate together so that I can avoid getting into details which will be counterproductive and focus on the essentials of the classes. In order to do this we will complete CRC diagrams.

As a Team Member I want to have a general idea of what our basic views will look like. This will help our front end developers have a general idea of what to aim towards when constructing views.

#### Artifacts

The artifacts for this deliverable are in our repo within our deliverables folder:

* CRC (CRC.pdf)
* Analysis of the problems with Facebook Marketplace (facebook_problems.pdf)
* View Mocks (view-mock.pdf)

* Scrum Artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, meeting schedule): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHT57hwY_5hdanTw9rLCbr0QdopAXCnvRaVo4S0Ht8E/edit?usp=sharing
