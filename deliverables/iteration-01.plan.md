 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 4th 2018
 * End date: October 12th 2018

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

Devs:
    Front End:
     > Our Front End devs will be responsible for the operation and implementation of the user interface of our application.
     > They will be responsible for producing the views and designing them accordingly to fit our target users needs while remaining simple enough for ease of learning by novice users
    Back End:
     > Our Back End devs will be responsible for storing the data of our application
     > They will also be responsible for implementing methods to return appropriate (dependant on the request) data upon user request .
Product Owner:
 > Responsible for maintaining the product backlog
 > Responsible for prioritizing features list for our application
 > To act as our lead user of our application in order to help translate a understanding of users and their needs to the development teams.
 > Motivate team with a clear and elevating goal
Scrum Master:
 > Responsible for the removal and reduction of impediments and blockers of productivity
 > Facilitator of meetings
 > Ensures the team is adhering to the sprint plan and backlog


#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

 As our team is constructed of persons who live close to/on campus and commuters we will have our meetings online via a
 voice chat app called Discord. We will also have a Facebook group chat for day to day communications and announcements.

 We will hold two primary meetings, a sprint planning and a sprint retrospective meeting.

 The purpose of our sprint planning meetings is to layout a sprint plan as well as to construct our sprint backlog from
  our product backlog. We will choose what tasks will be completed based upon our estimations on how much work we can
  complete during that sprint. Our sprint planning meetings will also include some backlog grooming if necessary. We will
  also bring up any concerns for the future sprint such as if a team member is unable to take a certain amount of work
  due to other commitments such as upcoming exams etc.

 The purpose of our sprint retrospective meetings are to evaluate the amount and quality of work done in the recent
 sprint. From this evaluation we can make conclusions and observations about the amount of work put into our future
 sprint backlogs if for instance we were unable to complete the amount planned previously. We will also discuss the
 processes we are using for collaboration and implementation of work, so that we can expand on processes that work and
 re-evaluate those which did not. We will also go over our corresponding sprint  plan to see if we were able to meet the
 goals set.

 We will also use our tutorials as a quick weekly catch up where everyone will discuss their work done, their plans for
 the upcoming week and any concerns if anyone were to have them about their work.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

   The artifact which we will keep and maintain in order to keep track of tasks will be a product backlog which will be
   a google doc spreadsheet with each task and their respective priority.Tasks will be prioritized by order of importance
   and each tasks dependency on others, so for example if a task depends on another being implemented prior, we will
   prioritize the task being depended on over the task which is dependant.

   Tasks will be split up and assigned based on the nature of the tasks. So front end tasks will be given to front end
   devs and back end tasks to back end devs.

   We will also keep a schedule of our planned meetings in a accessible location in order for ease of access for all
   team members. We will also take attendance at each meeting whether in person or online in order to ensure all members
   are contributing. During each meeting a summary will be produced for future record of what was discussed.



## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

For this iteration we will firstly get our scrum artifacts set up and have our design artifacts such as CRC diagrams ready. We also want to conduct research into our main competitor to understand our users better.

As a Team Member I want to know the pros and cons of the pre-existing facebook textbook marketplace so that I know what features are beneficial and standard among our market and what features to add to make our product stand out. In order to do this we will analyze the Facebook Textbook Marketplace.

As a Team Member I want to know the different classes we will implement, their responsibilities and how they collaborate together so that I can avoid getting into details which will be counterproductive and focus on the essentials of the classes. In order to do this we will complete CRC diagrams.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

The artifacts for this deliverable are in our repo within our deliverables folder.
