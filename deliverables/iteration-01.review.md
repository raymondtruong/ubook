 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 12th
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 Online meetings over Discord : Allowed us to collaborate and communicate even though not all team members are in
 walking distance to campus

 Utilization of Google Docs : Allowed us all to make contributions to our documents used for writing our planning and
 review docs. Also allows each member to be able to access scrum artifacts such as backlogs and meeting schedules so
 everyone is able to keep up to date.

 Project Group Chat: Allowed for our team to have day to day conversations about tasks and allows us to be accessible to
 each other in times of needed collaboration.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

For this Iteration we focused on conducting research and having all members comfortable with accessing and contributing
 to the backlogs and the required meetings documentation.

CRC Cards : We were able to complete our CRC cards which allowed us to have a strong understanding on the different
classes we need to implement as well as how they will work together within our application.

Facebook Textbook Marketplace Analysis: This allowed us to get a insight on what are the basic features our users will
expect as well as which features will differentiate our product from our main competitor.

Scrum Artifacts: We were able to construct backlogs and schedules in order to help our team stay organized and have
clear tasks set out for our project

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
