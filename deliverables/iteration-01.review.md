 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 14th
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 Online meetings over Discord : Allowed us to collaborate and communicate even though not all team members are in
 walking distance to campus

 Utilization of Google Docs : Allowed us all to make contributions to our documents used for writing our planning and
 review docs. Also allows each member to be able to access scrum artifacts such as backlogs and meeting schedules so
 everyone is able to keep up to date.

 Project Group Chat: Allowed for our team to have day to day conversations about tasks and allows us to be accessible to
 each other in times of needed collaboration.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Originally we thought that we would be able to coordinate in person meetings, however since we all have unique schedules this proved to be difficult.

We still have no concrete agreed upon assignment of roles for our project. Even though we were able to divide ourselves into different development sub teams, we still had ambiguity in regards to what exactly each member was responsible for.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

We decided that we will assign both the front-end and the back-end a “coordinator” who would will assign each member of the team tasks to complete for each sprint. The front-end and back-end work is mostly separate, but still requires a lot of cohesion within the sub-teams, which is why we decided to create these roles. These “coordinators” can also talk to one another to coordinate between sub-teams. This way, there is an agreed upon chain of communication between the sub-teams. 

We will construct a role contract which will state the assigned roles and have each team member sign it so that we have a record of the agreed upon roles.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

For this Iteration we focused on conducting research and having all members comfortable with accessing and contributing
 to the backlogs and the required meetings documentation. The artifacts mentioned below can be found in our deliverables
 folder.

CRC Cards : We were able to complete our CRC cards which allowed us to have a strong understanding on the different
classes we need to implement as well as how they will work together within our application.

Facebook Textbook Marketplace Analysis: This allowed us to get a insight on what are the basic features our users will
expect as well as which features will differentiate our product from our main competitor.

Scrum Artifacts: We were able to construct backlogs and schedules in order to help our team stay organized and have
clear tasks set out for our project

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

We were not able to complete view mocks in actual HTML/CSS code. These were left uncompleted because of time constraints but we were still able to produce simple view mocks by hand so that we did not lose the benefits of doing this task.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

Going into the next iteration we will establish “coordinators” for our Front End and Back End development teams. These “coordinators” will act as a team leader ensuring that each subteam stays on course throughout the sprint. They will also have the responsibility of coordinating with the other subteam coordinators to allow for all our teams to stay synchronized with their tasks and to avoid implementation conflicts 

Each sub team’s coordinator  will be responsible for collaborating with their teams prior to sprint planning to have a set of tasks (taken from product backlog) which will be their tasks to complete during that sprint. The selected tasks will contribute to the sprint backlog for that specific iteration as the selected tasks are a representation of what that subteam believes can be completed within that sprint.

There are a number of available open source tools that can help use reduce development time. We will be conducting extensive research on which tools will provide the most benefit to our project, as well learn how to properly use them to aid in the development of our project.
