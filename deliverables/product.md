# UBook

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build UBook, a textbook marketplace website where University of Toronto students can buy and sell used textbooks quickly, easily, confidently, and effectively.

Hunting for textbooks is something that every university student dreads. Buying brand new textbooks from the UofT bookstore or from an online retailer like Amazon is prohibitively expensive, costing students hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. This forces students to buy used textbooks from other students, and especially at the beginning of the school year, this a tedious process that costs students precious time, energy, and money. To make matters worse, the services that students currently use for this, such as Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace, are general-purpose exchange websites for any goods or services and are therefore not well-suited to the exchange of textbooks specifically. Attached is an artifact explaining all the issues with UBook’s main competitor, Facebook Marketplace.

UBook, a service catered specifically towards textbooks for UofT students, aims to solve all the issues faced when using its competitors by removing the hassle from buying and selling textbooks. It has three specific goals:

* Ensure both buyers and sellers get the best possible deal
* Ensure that postings contain all the useful and relevant pieces of information needed for a deal to be made
* Make communication and transparency as easy and fast as possible

In order to achieve this, we plan on implementing additional features that are advantageous over its competitors, such as textbook lookup by UofT course code, advanced sort by textbook condition and price, special listings for textbook bundles, direct links to Amazon and the university bookstore for comparison, and price analysis based on the  average market price.




#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target audience is University of Toronto students who are looking to purchase second-hand textbooks at the best price possible, in the best condition possible, as easily as possible. However, our product is scalable, so in theory it is definitely possible to expand to other schools, or to list other items other than textbooks such as tutoring services or even on-campus housing that other users may be interested in.

Let's imagine a typical user of UBook:

* Alice, a 1st year computer science student, is overwhelmed by her transition to university, and doesn't know what textbooks she needs. Kijiji isn't very useful, because people only list their textbooks by title or author. She can’t seem to find the difference between two similar-looking listings because the sellers weren’t specific enough with which edition they were selling. Once she finally finds the answer, she doesn’t realize that she might as well buy a brand new copy from the bookstore because neither her nor the buyer did any research into the market for this book.
* Jean, a 2nd year economics student, is very careful with his money, knowing that his student loans are creeping into 6 figures. He wants to ensure that he is getting the best deal possible on his textbooks. He wants to know how much money he’s saving by purchasing textbooks used rather than new. However, Facebook and Kijiji don’t offer any mechanism to easily compare postings of the same textbook, or compare a textbook’s used price to its brand new price. Jean also wants to sell his old textbooks to make some money, but he keeps finding himself selling his textbooks for too low of a price due to his lack of knowledge about the market for his textbooks.
* Georgio, a 3rd year architecture student, is very nitpicky about his school supplies. He wants all of his textbooks in perfect condition, with no highlighted parts or water damage. However, nobody on Facebook or Kijiji seems to include information about condition in their textbook postings. Even if they do, it is impossible to group ads based on their textbook condition.
* Rachel, a 4th year engineering science student who also works a part-time job, has very little free time. She wants to devote as little time as possible to finding textbooks, so she can do things she actually enjoys. However, Facebook and Kijiji’s search functionality is clumsy, especially for textbooks. Moreover, Rachel has a class that requires three textbooks, but she can only find ads for individual textbooks on Facebook and Kijiji, which makes the textbook exchange process even longer for her. Rachel also wants to sell her old textbooks, but people take forever to respond to her ads due to the lack of information Rachel put in them.  


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?


Online marketplace websites are no stranger to Internet users of this generation. There are plenty of sites which fundamentally offer the exact same thing: Kijiji, Craigslist, Letgo, and Facebook Marketplace are perhaps the main players. However, many of these (such as UBook's main competitors - Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace) are a little bit too general-purpose, so they value simplicity over functionality. As a result, although a wide range of products and services can be posted, it can be hard to find exactly what you're looking for because their search and sort criteria are lacklustre at best.

UBook, on the other hand, is specifically designed to do one thing and to do it well: facilitate the exchange of textbooks in a way that can be easily accessible to any UofT student. We can now see why UBook is superior:

* Alice can simply search UBook by course code and see a set of listings for each and every textbook that she may need. She can instantly see its price compared to its average market value. If she doesn’t think she’s getting a good deal, then she knows immediately and she can look for another listing. Or, if she doesn't like what she sees altogether, then there is a direct link to the university bookstore so that she can buy a brand new copy instead.
* Jean uses UBook because it makes it easy to compare prices of the same second-hand textbook on the marketplace. He can simply sort the textbooks he needs by price, or do an advanced search that only shows textbooks that are within his budget. When he’s selling a textbook, UBook shows the average price of the textbook on the UBook marketplace as well as the brand new price, so Jean can gauge the market and make sure he gets the most money out of the sale. Jean uses UBook because it saves him money.
* Georgio uses UBook because UBook ads force the seller to list all pertinent information regarding the textbooks, including its condition. UBook’s advanced search allows Georgio to sort the textbook he needs by condition, or omit textbooks that are in bad condition. UBook’s notification system also has the capability of notifying Georgio via email when the textbook with the exact specifications he is looking for is posted. Georgio uses UBook because it finds him the exact textbooks he wants.
* Rachel uses UBook for its search functionality, which is optimized for textbooks. Rachel often searches for textbook by course code, so she doesn’t have to remember that super long textbook name and edition number. UBook’s “bundle” feature, where sellers can bundle multiple textbooks for the same course into one ad, makes buying those three textbooks for that one class easy for Rachel. Rachel’s UBook ads are more complete and are responded to way faster than her messy Facebook or Kijiji ads, because they encourage her to add all the necessary information, in an easy and intuitive way. Rachel uses UBook because it saves her time.

It's not that the current solutions don't work -- they definitely do -- it's just that UBook takes things to the next level by taking the hard work out of buying or selling textbooks.
